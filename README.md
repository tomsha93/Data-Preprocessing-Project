<p><b>Project description<b> <br><br>
Our project is to prepare a report for a bank&rsquo;s loan division. We&rsquo;ll need to find out if a customer&rsquo;s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers&rsquo; credit worthiness. The report will be considered when building a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.</p>
